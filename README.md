This repo replicates the study in the paper and referenced the code the authors published.[BOND: BERT-Assisted Open-Domain Name Entity Recognition with Distant Supervision (KDD2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15509). It used a dataset with changes since the evaluation result will be a little different.
